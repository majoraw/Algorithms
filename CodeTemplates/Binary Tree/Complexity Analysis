As we mentioned before, we can traverse a tree recursively to retrieve all the data  We can traverse a tree recursively to retrieve all the data in pre-order, in-order or post-order. 
The time complexity is O(N) because we visit each node exactly once. 
And the depth of the tree might be N in the worst case. 
That is to say, the level of recursion might be at most N in the worst case. 
Therefore, taking system stack into consideration, the space complexity is O(N) as well.

To be cautious, the complexity might be different due to a different implementation. 
It is comparatively easy to do traversal recursively but when the depth of the tree is too large, we might suffer from stack overflow problem. 
That's one of the main reasons why we want to solve this problem iteratively sometimes. 

For the iterative solution, the time complexity is apparently the same with recursion solution which is O(N). 
The space complexity is also O(N) since in the worst case, we will have all the nodes in the stack. 
There are some other solutions for iterative traversal which can reduce the space complexity to O(1).

//Level Order Traversal
Since each node in the tree will be pushed into the queue exactly once, the time complexity for level-order traversal is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.

What about the space complexity? We have to maintain a queue to help us to do the traversal. And the size of the queue will be at most N because each node will be pushed into the queue exactly once. 
Therefore, the space complexity of level-order traversal is also O(N).
